# ANN
##Juan Barron

This project is to learn the inner workings on an AI.
I learned a simple model [ANN](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-an-artificial-neural-network-ann-from-scratch-part-1-a21988497962).
The article uses pyhton, I made my ANN in java to better understand it.
Java does not have a numpy so for [Dot Product](https://youtu.be/kuixY2bCc_0) or [Transpose](https://chortle.ccsu.edu/VectorLessons/vmch13/vmch13_14.html) so I made my own methods.
